(** This library offers a lightweight way for applications protocols to version
    themselves. The more protocols that add themselves to [Known_protocol], the nicer
    error messages we will get when connecting to a service while using the wrong
    protocol.

    The library also offers a mechanism for some data to be shared in the connection
    header. A header can contain [additional_magic_numbers] that are not used in the
    version negotiation but can be used in some way by the peer (e.g. the kerberos rpc
    library could use this to indicate whether the server is doing any form of
    authorization).

(** [create_exn] raises if one of the following is true:
    - [List.length supported_versions + List.length additional_magic_numbers >= 100]
    - [supported_versions] containing version number greater than [max_supported_version]
    - [additional_magic_numbers] containing version numbers not greater than
      [max_supported_version]
    - [additional_magic_numbers] overlaps with potential magic values for [protocol]s. *)

(** [negotiate ~allow_legacy_peer ~us ~peer] inspects the magic numbers of [us] and
    [peer]. If the magic numbers match, the highest shared version number is returned.

    magic number exists. *)

    saying whether this magic number was observed. *)

(** [any_magic_prefix] and [any_magic_prefix_from_six_bytes] read the magic number for
    one of the known protocols. They differ in how many bytes they read.

    [any_magic_prefix] reads the entire [Protocol_version_header.t] and then checks if
    there's any magic prefix in there. The number of bytes in the bin_io representation of
    a [Protocol_version_header.t] is not fixed because it depends on the supported
    versions of the protocol.

    [any_magic_prefix_from_six_bytes] reads exactly 6 bytes to check magic prefix.

    [any_magic_prefix_from_six_bytes_bin_size] is 6: the number of bytes that
    [any_magic_prefix_from_six_bytes] reads.
